Gatsby & MDX Walkthrough - Section 4 of this Udemy Course: [Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course by John Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/)

# Getting tailwind installed

1. Used the Option #1: PostCSS route [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/)
2. Add a global css file with the @tailwind directives [ref](https://dev.to/jakedohm_34/using-tailwind-with-gatsby-js-10fj)
3. Only included @tailwind utilities directive to prevent base tailwind styles from overwriting MDX formatting

# TODO - Purging and using with styled components

- See [here](https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind) for combining with PurgeCSS to remove unnecessary Tailwin classes from bundle
- See [here](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara) for Tailwind + StyledComponents
- See [here](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-tailwind-css-with-gatsby-react-emotion-styled-components) for Tailwind + Emotion no need for PurgeCSS
