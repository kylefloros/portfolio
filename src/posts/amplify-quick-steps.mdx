- Cognito
- Default
- Follow options, edit GraphQL schema
- amplify push (this is where it broke before)
- obv options
- graphql mutations/queries/subs in src now
- npm i aws-amplify aws-amplify-react

aws-amplify package that allows us to interact with our aws resources - Make requests to api - Auth users

aws-amplify-react - Useful react components

Add this to index:
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import aws_exports from './aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(aws_exports)

Add this to App:
export default withAuthenticator(App, { includeGreetings: true});
HOC, detect users auth state, update UI, if signed in see component, else see sign up/in form

Go to localhost sign up a user

Adding @auth
amplify update api

amplify add hosting
for CRA: index.html for both

amplify publish

To get hosting endpoint
amplify status
